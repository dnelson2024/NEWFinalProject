        label4.text = "Main Factor Attributed To The Issue: Permanent removal of native vegetation. \n \n Without vegetation to absorb the water, hold the dirt, and break up the energy of rain drops, there is more erosion which causes land degredation. \n The lack of vegetation cover reduces the habitat for animals which can lead to too many aniamsl grazing the land. The animals can damage the land with their hooves leading to land degredation. \n \n \n Why Is The Issue Still Prevalent? : \n \n 1) Degredated lands are not able to hold water as well, so there is a greater chance for floods. \n 2) It can also lead to a decrease of food production which is dangerous considering the quickly growing human population. \n Land degredation can also lead to an increase of pollution which is dangerour \n Lastly it can lead to desertification. \n \n \n Positive Developments: \n \n 1) Laser grading of irrigation land. \n 2) Reduced use of pesti- cides and trash retention. \n 3) The implementation of ground covers, alternate fuels, timber replantation, and dams are steps that have been taking to manage land degredation. \n 4) The Australian governmet is promoting agricultural planning and production without clearing trees, advocating for more biodiversity laws that protect the habitat, and campaigning for a stop to deforestation. \n 5) Organic agriculture can preserve the top soil because of the lack of chemicals. \n \n \n Companies And NGOs To Support \n \n 1) The Biome of Australian Soil Environments (BASE) - Maps soil biodiversity of the continent. \n 2) Youth Food Movement -Delivered  projects to address food waste, aging farming population, and soil degradation. \n 3) Australian Conservation Foundation - Solve climate crisis and stand up for nature.  \n 4) Regenerative Australian Farmers (RAF) -  Help restorative farming practices that lead to atmospheric carbon being returned to soil,  soil sponge rehydrated, reduced emissions and farm productivity increased. \n \n \n What Can You Do To Help? \n \n 1) Donate to companies and NGOs such as the ones listed above. \n 2) Spread awareness. \n 3) Contact local representatives about your concerns for the environment."
