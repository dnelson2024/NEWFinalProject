        label3.text = "Main Factors Attributed To The Issue: \n \n Low soil fertility, soil erosion, human activities effects on the soil chemistry \n \n - 280 million tonnes of cereal crop is lost annually due to desertification. \n - Estimated 20,000 hectares of land is lost per year to desertification. \n \n \n Why Is The Issue Still Prevalent? : \n \n Population growth, deforestation, overgrazing, drought. \n - African land is one of the oldest in the world, being roughly 600 million years old. The soil is 2 million years old and activities such as obtaining food, fibre, fuel and shelter have affected the soil's mineral deposits. \n - 70% of Ethopia and 80% of Kenya is prone to desertification and around 50 million would have to move from desertified regions to other continents which could lead to a massive rise in immigrants and unstability. \n \n \n Positive Developments: \n \n 1) The Great Green Wall is an initiative by the African Union to help battle desertification by planting a wall of trees at the southern edge of the Sahara (from Dakar to Djibouti). The wall would be 15 km. wide and 7,100 km. long. \n 2) Action Against Desertification is an initiative of the African, Carribean and Pacific Group of States to restore dry lands and degraded lands. \n \n \n Companies And NGOs To Support: \n \n 1) United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) : Restores land and comes up with ways to prevent such issues in the future. \n 2) Giving Life Nature Volunteer (GILVANO) : Encourages volunteerism in students, women, institutions and well-wishers in order to protect natural resources and the environment.  \n 3) Green Africa Foundation : Promotes environmental conservation as one of its key pillars and encourages individuals to plant trees and make a 'green' Africa. \n 4) The Horn of Africa Regional Environment Centre and Network (HoA-REC&N) : Promotion of environmental conservation and natural resuorces management in the Horn of Africa region. \n \n \n What Can You Do To Help? \n \n 1) Planting more trees to prevent soil erosion. \n 2) Improving soil quality around you through organic products and manure. \n 3) Reducing influence of chemicals in agriculture. \n 4) Extracting products from the soil responsibly."
