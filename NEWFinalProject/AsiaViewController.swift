        label6.text = "Main Factors Attributed To The Issue: \n \n Population growth + rapid urbanisation and climate change \n \n - 270 million people are projected to be affected by melting of the Indus glaciers, leading to a large-scale water crisis. \n - Water distribution is also unequal across different regions in South and South-east Asian countries. \n - The problem isn't the amount of water but rather the amount of safe, drinkable water. In less developed countries, water is considered a luxury and political commodity \n \n \n Why Is The Issue Still Prevalent? : \n \n Industrialization, lack of conservation in areas like agriculture/daily use and environmental factors. \n \n \n Positive Developments: \n \n 1) China is aiming to desalinate 2-3 million tonnes of water daily by 2030. \n 2) Indian govt. aims to ensure safe drinking water to every rural household by 2024. \n \n \n Companies And NGOs To Support \n \n 1) South Asian Water Initiative (SAWI) : Spanning across 7 countires, it focuses on strengthening awareness and knowledge about regional water issues. \n 2) WaterAid : Spanning across 30 countries, WaterAid aims to end water crisus by the end of the next decade and focuses on producing long term clean water through sufficient education and revolutionary technology. \n 3) Safe Water Network : Strives to help build affordable, locally owned water systems and plans to access safe water for 50 millionn people by 2026.  \n 4) Planet Water Foundation : Serves schools, children and rural communities worldwide by installing water filtration systems and launching health education programs. \n \n \n What Can You Do To Help? \n \n 1) Use water judicially. \n 2) Time your water usage; turn off taps while brushing or use water sand clocks that signify the amount of time you can use water without wasting it. \n 3) Not leaving stagnant water (besides being water wastage, it also serves as breeding ground for multiple mosquito-bred diseases)."
